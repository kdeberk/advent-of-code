This is a repository in which I put all my work for the annual Advent of Code challenges.

Every year I try to use a different programming language.
For the years 2016 - 2019, the following languages were used:
2016: x86 Assembly
2017: Ruby
2018: Rust
2019: Go

I have not decided yet on a language for the 2015 and future editions. Candidates are
- APL
- Clojure
- Common Lisp
- Erlang
- Forth
- Haskell
- Idris
- Pony
- Prolog
- Scheme
- Zig
