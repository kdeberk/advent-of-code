This is a repository in which I put all my work for the annual Advent of Code challenges.

Every year I try to use a different programming language.
For the years 2016 - 2020, the following languages were used:
- 2016: x86 Assembly
- 2017: Ruby
- 2018: Rust
- 2019: Go
- 2020: Clojure

I have not decided yet on a language for the 2015 and future editions. Candidates are
- Ada
- APL
- Elixir
- Erlang
- Forth
- Fortran
- Haskell
- OCaml
- Perl
- Prolog
- Scala
- Scheme
